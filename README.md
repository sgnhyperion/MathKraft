# Fractions Game - Problem Statement

## Overview
This project aims to develop an interactive educational game focused on teaching and reinforcing fraction concepts through an engaging, visually appealing interface.

## Game Design Reference
Design Mockup: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/MNBVvPXRRDYXtI8jk9ogzA/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=wyhaXPzmBdf7RM2n-1)

## Problem Domain
The game is designed to help students (primarily at the elementary and middle school levels) understand and practice the conversion of mixed fractions to improper fractions.

## Key Objectives
1. **Educational Goal**: 
   - Teach fraction concepts through interactive gameplay
   - Provide visual representations of mixed fractions

## Setup
This is a standard React Next.js project. You can install the necessary modules by running `npm install`, and then start the project with `npm run dev`.

## Technical Requirements
- A responsive React web-based game
- Built on top of the starter template provided
- Use the Figma design as a reference
- You can select either:
  - Screen 1
  - Screen 2 and 3 
- Use the variables in the `game/game-state.tsx` file as the game state
- Use the `game/state-utils.tsx` file to manage the game state
- Stick to the screen and step structure in the `game/game-state.tsx` file. The screen notation is well defined in the Figma design, and you can use steps as needed to navigate through the game
- Use modular components for the game screens, with components located in the `game/components` folder

## Submissions
- Clone the repository.
- Make the necessary changes to the code.
- Submit a zip (or tar.gz) file containing the game, along with a short video recording of the gameplay.
- Email the zip file to [sahasra@mathkraft.org](mailto:sahasra@mathkraft.org) with your contact details.

## Guidelines
- Don't spend more than 2 days on the assignment.
- You are free to explore any libraries and frameworks.
- Keep the game lightweight; don't overcomplicate the implementation.
- We would prefer a good game with just one screen over an average game with all three screens.
- You can use design references from this document: [Commonly used modules](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cHely2VYA7HXrjVtYUagfB_XY-70G01k/view?usp=sharing)
- Submissions will be judged on the following criteria:
  - Code quality and modularity
  - Game design and functionality
  - User experience
